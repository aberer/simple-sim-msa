==============

a simple and not necessarily meaningful generator for multiple sequence alignments

You will need a newick tree as an input (see the example file). 

Quick start: in order to simulate the evolution of sequences (length=100) along an
assumed input tree, type: 

./sms.py  example.tre  100
